    "# 🎯 Phase-F Final synthesis and future directions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**\n",
    "\n",
    "This final phase synthesises the complete workflow from open data acquisition to external validation. It summarises the methodological contributions of the work, clarifies what the framework achieves, and positions the study within the broader urban assessment literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this work demonstrates**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents a fully reproducible framework for estimating **urban environmental comfort potential** using open data only.\n",
    "The approach integrates acoustic exposure, vegetation, structural crowd pressure, and accessibility into a transparent composite score measured on a consistent spatial support.\n",
    "Validation is performed using independent structural proxies rather than behavioural or survey data, ensuring ethical robustness and auditability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is new and why it matters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Novel contributions**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Demonstrates that meaningful urban comfort assessment can be achieved without surveys, tracking, or personal data.\n",
    "* Computes all components on matched spatial support, reducing scale mismatch and improving interpretability.\n",
    "* Uses a conservative validation strategy based on convergent spatial structure rather than prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework provides a transparent alternative to opaque wellbeing indices and black box models.\n",
    "It is suitable for policy exploration, comparative urban analysis, and reproducible research where ethical and data governance constraints are critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations and future directions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "* ComfortScore represents structural environmental potential rather than perceived comfort or lived experience.\n",
    "* The framework is applied to inner London, and score distributions are not expected to generalise directly across cities without local adaptation.\n",
    "* Proxy availability and quality may vary across urban contexts.\n",
    "* This abstraction avoids the need for historical venue reconstruction while remaining appropriate for structural urban analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Future directions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Future work could explore adaptive weighting, additional open proxies, and application to cities with different urban morphologies.\n",
    "The framework is designed to scale geographically while preserving transparency and reproducibility.\n"
